I've been contemplating whether to make my portfolio repository public because it's still a work in progress... but I decided to just go with it, so bear with me - haha.

This project has been one of my favorites because it has allowed me to showcase my personality and build my own personal branding. However, it’s also been the most challenging — designing for yourself is <em> a lot </em> tougher than working with any client.

 If I were to start over, I’d definitely use a preprocessor like SCSS. Even though I keep tweaking the elements and layout, I had the colors and typography nailed down from the start, so SCSS would have been extremely helpful. I also would have prioritized responsiveness from the beginning, but I got a bit sidetracked while designing during the coding process.

Usually, I design first and then dive into coding, but that wasn’t the case here due to my own indecisiveness about the design. It’s been a learning experience and I'm really excited about how it's turning out, but I’m excited to keep refining the code and design going forward!
